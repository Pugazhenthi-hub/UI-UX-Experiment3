# UI-UX-Experiment3

## Aim

The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the user experience (UX) of two popular social media platforms—Instagram and YouTube—using Jakob Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics.

The objective is to identify usability strengths and weaknesses, compare both platforms, and recommend improvements to enhance usability, engagement, and user satisfaction.

## Algorithm


Step 1: Selection of Apps

Instagram

YouTube

Step 2: Define Framework

Uploading posts/videos

Searching for content

Using comments and likes

Managing notifications

Switching between features

Step 4: Heuristic Evaluation

Evaluate each app against the 10 heuristics.

Step 5: Comparative Analysis

Create a comparison table and highlight strengths.

Step 6: Problem Identification

Identify usability issues affecting user experience.

Step 7: Recommendations

Suggest improvements aligned with UX best practices.

Step 8: Conclusion

Summarize findings and determine which app provides stronger UX.
